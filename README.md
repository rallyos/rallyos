<h3 align="center">👋 Hey there</h3>

I started as a Python developer, but quickly found out how addicting is to learn new technologies. Now... I haven't learned THAT much new ones (you can always do more about this), but I like being generalist because it has positive effect on my knowledge and coding productivity. Vim is my daily driver through code, although I often feel I use only 20% of its capabilities and I definitely need to do something about it. I have interests in astronomy and rocketry, so hopefully some day in the future I'll be able to employ my skills there.
